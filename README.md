"Would you like to know more?"

This is a community-driven, action-packed reimagining of Space Station 14 based in a war-torn future where humanity battles endless hordes of alien bugs.

## Status

- Bug factions
- Propaganda systems
- Trooper classes
- High command AI
- Persistent Map / Galaxy Layer: A solar system map UI where players can see planets, moons, etc
- Faction Progression: Persistent war effort winning or losing affects control of systems, resources, etc.

2. Run `RUN_THIS.py` to init submodules and download the engine.
